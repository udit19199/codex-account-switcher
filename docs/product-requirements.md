# Product requirements

## 1. Goal

Allow an ordinary Mac user with multiple authorized ChatGPT accounts to add them through browser sign-in and choose which account Codex Desktop uses from the menu bar, without Terminal commands or config-file editing.

The user should understand the product after opening the menu once. The main path should require no configuration.

## 2. Scope

### In scope

- macOS menu-bar application;
- saved local account profiles;
- one weekly Usage value and an optional exact 5-hour Usage value per account;
- reset times for available Usage windows;
- account switching;
- add account;
- remove inactive account;
- English and Simplified Chinese UI.

### Out of scope

- quota-window selector;
- automatic rotation;
- failover;
- round-robin routing;
- account recommendation;
- automatic switching when Usage is low;
- general rollback and recovery state machines;
- server-side session revocation;
- Windows and Linux releases;
- syncing profiles between Macs.

## 3. Primary user stories

### US-1: Inspect accounts

As a user, I can open the menu-bar popover and immediately see saved accounts, weekly Usage, and reset time. I can optionally enable a 5-hour row.

### US-2: Switch accounts

As a user, I can select a different account, read the normal consequences, confirm once, and have Codex Desktop reopen under that account.

### US-3: Add an account

As a user, I can open Manage Accounts, add another ChatGPT account through Codex login, and save it as a selectable profile.

### US-4: Remove an account

As a user, I can remove an inactive local profile from Manage Accounts.

### US-5: Change language

As a user, I can choose System Default, English, or Simplified Chinese.

## 4. Menu-bar trigger

The menu-bar item uses a compact account-group icon with an accessibility label. It does not wait for account or Usage data before appearing.

The popover content width is 326 points.

## 5. Account row

### 5.1 Layout

With `Show 5-hour Usage` disabled, each row keeps the compact layout:

```text
[avatar]  Email Address                    Resets Aug 25, 9:20 AM
          Usage  [================----]                 42% left
```

Constraints:

- use the full saved email as the title, falling back to the display name when email is missing or empty;
- keep the title on one line with tail ellipsis and show its full text in a floating tooltip on hover;
- reset time is on the name line;
- `Usage` is the only quota label;
- the percentage is remaining percentage;
- the progress bar width equals the displayed percentage;
- the current account is a row highlight;
- no checkmark is shown;
- no `Current` text is shown.

With `Show 5-hour Usage` enabled and exact 5-hour data available, the row expands:

```text
[avatar]  Email Address
          5h   [==========------]  65%  Resets 2:20 PM
          7d   [========--------]  42%  Resets Aug 25, 9:20 AM
```

The 5-hour line is omitted when its data is absent. The UI does not show an unavailable placeholder for that line. English and Simplified Chinese window labels remain fully visible.

### 5.2 Usage-window normalization

Input from Codex may include more than one rate-limit window. One `account/rateLimits/read` response supplies both normalized windows.

Select `rateLimitsByLimitId["codex"]` when present, otherwise the legacy top-level `rateLimits`. Read only that bucket’s `primary` and `secondary` windows, then choose the longest window whose duration is six through eight days. Other metered products must not supply Codex Usage:

```text
fiveHour = first(windows where windowDurationMins == 300)
weekly = max(windows where 8640 <= windowDurationMins <= 11520)
```

If no six-to-eight-day window exists:

```text
Usage unavailable
```

The UI must not infer a weekly value from a short window, regardless of whether Codex labels it `primary` or `secondary`. Four-hour and six-hour windows must not be labeled as five-hour Usage. Missing 5-hour data preserves valid weekly Usage.

### 5.3 Percentage

```text
usedPercent = window.usedPercent
remainingPercent = clamp(100 - usedPercent, 0, 100)
```

Examples:

| `usedPercent` | UI text | Bar width |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0 | `100% left` | 100% |
| 24 | `76% left` | 76% |
| 58 | `42% left` | 42% |
| 100 | `0% left` | 0% |

### 5.4 Reset formatting

If `resetsAt` is available, render it in the user's locale and timezone:

```text
Resets Aug 25, 9:20 AM
```

If it is absent:

```text
Reset unknown
```

## 6. Main-menu footer

The footer contains exactly three equal-width actions:

1. `Manage Accounts`
2. `Settings`
3. `Quit`

Manage Accounts and Settings open inside the current popover and provide a Back action. Every new popover opening starts on the account list, regardless of which secondary page was last visible.

Quit directly terminates the application, remains enabled while another operation runs, and is also available through Command-Q.

## 7. Switching flow

### 7.1 Selecting current account

Selecting the highlighted account closes the popover or does nothing. It does not restart Codex and does not show confirmation.

### 7.2 Selecting another account

Show a confirmation page inside the popover with this meaning:

> Switch to **{account name}**?
>
> Codex Desktop will close and reopen. A task currently running in Desktop may stop. Existing Codex CLI sessions continue with the account they started with. New CLI sessions use the selected account.

Actions:

- `Cancel`
- `Switch Account`

Cancel returns to the account list without closing the popover or starting the switch.

### 7.3 Progress

After confirmation, disable additional account actions while the six-stage operation runs:

- `Closing Codex Desktop…`
- `Saving current account…` (read and match the active identity before saving its credential)
- `Activating selected account…`
- `Verifying selected account…`
- `Saving selected account…`
- `Opening Codex Desktop…`

If Codex Desktop displays its quit warning for active local chats, the user handles that native dialog. The switcher waits up to 30 seconds for normal exit and never force-quits Desktop. A rejected quit request or timeout stops the switch before credentials change, preserving Desktop's opportunity to flush task history. The user can finish or stop tasks and close Desktop before switching again.

The stages are not configurable. A failure banner identifies the failed stage and retains the underlying diagnostic message.

### 7.4 Success

On success:

- the selected row becomes highlighted;
- `activeAccountID` is updated;
- Codex Desktop is reopened;
- the popover remains available on the account list.

### 7.5 Failure

On failure:

- stop immediately;
- do not continue to later stages;
- show the failed stage and the underlying error;
- keep the error visible until the user dismisses it.

If target activation completed and target verification or registry persistence fails, restore the active `auth.json` from the validated original profile saved earlier in the attempt. Keep the original failure visible. If restoration fails, show both the original and restoration errors. Do not restore after an activation failure that did not replace the credential, and keep the target account active when Desktop reopening fails after a successful registry commit.

This bounded repair does not add a general rollback state machine, credential backup file, retry, journal, or startup recovery.

## 8. Manage Accounts

### 8.1 List

Show:

- avatar or initials;
- full email as a single-line title with tail ellipsis and a floating full-text tooltip;
- local display name when email is missing or empty;
- active-state highlight;
- remove action for inactive profiles.

### 8.2 Add account

`Add Account` starts a Codex login using a new profile directory.

The browser sign-in hint sits to the right of the action on the same line. Long hints use tail ellipsis and expose the full text on hover, including while browser sign-in is pending.

Expected flow:

```text
create profile directory
→ run Codex login with CODEX_HOME=<profile directory>
→ read account identity
→ create profile metadata
→ return to Manage Accounts
```

Adding an account creates no current-account credential backup or rollback flow.

The browser sign-in wait is tracked separately from profile mutations so the account list, Settings, and existing account actions remain interactive. While sign-in is pending, Manage Accounts shows a direct cancel action. Canceling stops the app-server login session without presenting an operation error.

If login fails, show the original Codex login error and remove only this attempt’s unregistered profile directory. Cancellation performs the same cleanup without a login error. If cleanup fails, expose that failure alongside the original error. Already registered profiles are never removed by this cleanup. Duplicate identities are rejected; distinct account IDs remain separate even when their emails match.

### 8.3 Remove

Removing an inactive profile:

```text
persist removal from profile metadata
→ delete accounts/<profile-id>/
```

If metadata persistence fails, leave the credential directory intact. If directory deletion fails, restore the original account list and show the filesystem error; if this restoration also fails, show both errors. This does not guarantee atomic recursive deletion or process-crash recovery. Do not add a tombstone or deferred cleanup queue.

The active profile's remove control is disabled.

Remove first opens a confirmation page inside the popover. Cancel and the header Back action return to the account list without closing the popover or calling the remove operation.

## 9. Settings

The 326-point Settings page groups general preferences and software updates:

```text
Launch at Login                [toggle]
Show Percentage in Menu Bar   [toggle]
Show 5-hour Usage             [toggle]
Language  [System Default ▾]

Software Update
Check for updates automatically [toggle]
Hourly update description
Version 0.1.10      [Check for Updates]
```

All setting rows use 13-point system text, 14-point horizontal insets, a minimum 44-point height, and small native controls aligned to the right. Group captions and supporting descriptions use 11-point system text. Row separators share the text insets. Approval messages and update failures wrap below the relevant row using the same description layout.

Launch at Login reads and writes the main app's macOS Login Item registration. It shows a direct approval message and System Settings link for `requiresApproval`, and an unavailable message for `notFound`. The macOS status is the only source of truth and is not persisted in `settings.json`.

Show Percentage in Menu Bar, Show 5-hour Usage, and Language persist in `settings.json`. The 5-hour setting defaults to false when the field is absent from an older file. Language options are:

- System Default;
- English;
- 简体中文.

Changing any persisted setting updates the visible switcher UI immediately. Show 5-hour Usage affects account rows only; the menu-bar percentage continues to show weekly Usage.

## 10. Accessibility

- account rows are keyboard-focusable buttons;
- current row exposes selected state through accessibility APIs;
- progress bars expose `remainingPercent`;
- buttons have explicit labels;
- color is not the only selected-state signal: selected state must also be exposed semantically;
- text remains readable at standard macOS accessibility text sizes.

## 11. Performance

- popover should appear immediately from local metadata;
- persisted weekly and optional 5-hour Usage is rendered before refresh subprocesses complete;
- Usage refresh begins at application launch and whenever the popover opens;
- every refresh trigger replaces the pending timer with a refresh scheduled five minutes after that trigger;
- account refreshes run concurrently and overlapping triggers share the active refresh round;
- one app-owned timer remains active while the popover is closed;
- no automatic retry runs after an individual request fails;
- one failed account does not prevent other rows from rendering;
- switch actions are disabled while one switch is in progress.

## 12. Acceptance criteria

The MVP is accepted when:

1. three saved accounts can be displayed in the popover;
2. each row keeps the current weekly layout while Show 5-hour Usage is disabled;
3. enabling Show 5-hour Usage displays separate 5h and 7d lines when both values exist, and omits the 5h line when it is absent;
4. the progress bar exactly matches `NN% left`;
5. the current row is highlighted without a checkmark;
6. the footer contains equal-width Manage Accounts, Settings, and Quit actions;
7. the popover is 326 points wide and all secondary pages navigate inside it;
8. Settings contains launch-at-login, menu-bar percentage, 5-hour Usage, and language controls inside the popover;
9. every popover opening starts on the account list;
10. canceling switch or removal performs no mutation and keeps the popover open;
11. Quit and Command-Q terminate the application and remain available during mutations;
12. account switching follows the documented six-stage sequence;
13. a failure at any switch stage stops and is shown directly;
14. verification and registry-commit failures restore the validated original credential, with no general rollback state machine, backup file, journal, retry, or startup-recovery path;
15. existing CLI processes are not terminated;
16. newly started CLI processes observe the selected active `auth.json`;
17. cached Usage stays visible during refresh and is replaced after success;
18. closing the popover does not stop the pending five-minute background cache refresh;
19. inactive accounts can be added and removed; active accounts cannot be removed;
20. launch-at-login registration reflects the current macOS Login Item status and exposes approval requirements directly;
21. only `main` is required for the repository's steady state.

## 13. Switcher updates

Personal fork: no auto-update. Updates are `git pull` plus a local build.

## 14. First activation and external sign-in

With no registered active account and no active auth.json, selecting a saved account activates it directly after Desktop exits normally. Verification or registry persistence failure removes the newly installed active credential and leaves the app signed out. Existing unregistered credentials are never overwritten by this path.

Manage Accounts provides Register Current Account below Add Account. It reads the current shared login identity, updates that same identity’s saved credential or imports a new profile, and records it as active. A mismatch during switching links to Manage Accounts. Other profiles remain unchanged.
