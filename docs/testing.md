# Testing

## 1. Philosophy

The MVP test suite should prove two things:

1. the direct happy path works;
2. failures stop exactly where they occur and remain visible while the bounded pre-commit credential restoration preserves account consistency.

It should test the documented verification/commit restoration and confirm that no general rollback state machine, retry, credential backup file, journal, or startup recovery exists.

### Local toolchains

Xcode and GitHub-hosted macOS runners use SwiftPM's normal `Testing` module discovery. Some standalone Command Line Tools distributions place `Testing.framework` and `lib_TestingInterop.dylib` outside SwiftPM's default search paths. For that CLT layout, `Package.swift` derives the selected toolchain root from `xcrun --find swift` and adds only the required framework and runtime search paths when both files exist. The repository contains no fixed developer-directory path.

If `swift test` prints only `Build complete!`, the generated test entry point also needs the framework search path. On that CLT layout, run:

```sh
toolchain_root=$(dirname "$(dirname "$(dirname "$(xcrun --find swift)")")")
swift test -Xswiftc -F -Xswiftc "$toolchain_root/Library/Developer/Frameworks"
```

Require the `Test run with ... tests ... passed` summary before treating the suite as executed.

## 2. Unit tests

### 2.1 Usage windows

Test:

- `used=0` → `100% left`;
- `used=24` → `76% left`;
- `used=58` → `42% left`;
- `used=100` → `0% left`;
- values below 0 and above 100 are clamped;
- a six-to-eight-day window is selected from either `primary` or `secondary` buckets;
- exactly 300 minutes is accepted as the optional 5-hour window;
- 4-hour and 6-hour windows are not labeled as 5-hour Usage;
- absence of a six-to-eight-day window returns `Usage unavailable`;
- absence of a 5-hour window preserves valid weekly Usage;
- weekly-only cache entries from older versions still decode.

### 2.2 Profile repository

Test:

- load empty repository;
- create profile;
- save active credential into profile;
- activate profile credential;
- delete inactive profile;
- reject deleting active profile;
- persist normalized Usage with mode `0600`;
- load old settings without `showsFiveHourUsage` as false and persist later changes;
- remove cached Usage with its inactive profile;
- surface read, write, atomic replacement, and delete errors.

### 2.3 Identity matching

Test:

- matching account IDs succeed;
- differing account IDs fail;
- normalized matching emails succeed when account ID is unavailable;
- differing emails fail;
- missing ID and email fails.

## 3. Switch-flow tests

Use fakes for Desktop, account storage, and Codex identity.

Expected call order:

```text
closeDesktop
saveCurrent
activateTarget
readActiveIdentity
commitActiveAccountID
openDesktop
```

Inject an error at each call and assert:

- the error reports the correct `SwitchStage`;
- no later call occurs;
- no retry occurs;
- `isMutating` returns to false after presentation.

Specific partial-state assertions:

- the registry is read and `originalActiveID` is validated before saving or replacing credentials;
- activation error before replacement leaves state metadata unchanged and runs no restoration;
- verification error restores the original active credential and leaves the original metadata active;
- state-write error restores the original active credential and leaves the original metadata active;
- a retry after restoration cannot overwrite the original profile with target credentials;
- a restoration failure reports both the original and restoration errors;
- Desktop-open error leaves target auth and target metadata active.

Use both the fake store and the real `AccountStore` so call ordering, atomic credential installation, registry-write failure, and on-disk bytes are covered.

## 4. App-server fixture tests

Create a fake JSON-RPC child process that returns:

- identity success;
- identity mismatch;
- 5-hour and weekly rate-limit success from one response;
- response with both `primary` and `secondary`;
- response with `primary` only;
- malformed JSON;
- process exit;
- request timeout.

Assert that the client does not retry, makes one rate-limit request per read, and does not convert one duration into another Usage window.

`CodexExecutableLocatorTests` starts real sh, bash, and zsh login shells with isolated startup files.
Install fish to enable the fish regression check (it is explicitly skipped when fish is unavailable).
Each shell covers unset and empty `CODEX_CLI_PATH`, shell-local command and absolute-path overrides,
invalid overrides, startup output, paths containing spaces, and PATH inheritance by the launched child.

## 5. UI tests

Verify:

- current row is highlighted;
- both account lists use the full saved email, including its domain, as the primary title;
- account titles remain on one line with tail ellipsis, and hovering reveals the full title in a floating tooltip;
- missing or empty emails use the display name;
- the add-account hint sits to the right of its action on one line, with its full text available on hover;
- accounts with matching email prefixes and different domains remain distinguishable;
- no checkmark or `Current` label exists;
- reset text remains on the name line in the default compact layout;
- enabled 5-hour display shows separate 5h and 7d rows with percentages and reset times;
- enabled 5-hour display omits the 5h row when data is absent;
- English and Simplified Chinese Usage labels remain fully visible;
- progress-bar accessibility value equals `NN% left`;
- footer contains equal-width Manage Accounts, Settings, and Quit actions;
- Manage Accounts and Settings navigate inside the popover;
- reopening after closing a secondary page starts on the account list;
- Settings contains Launch at Login, Show Percentage in Menu Bar, Show 5-hour Usage, and Language in that order;
- Login Item status maps `notRegistered`, `enabled`, `requiresApproval`, and `notFound` to disabled, enabled, approval-required, and unavailable UI states;
- all three Settings toggles expose localized accessibility labels;
- switch confirmation describes Desktop and CLI consequences;
- canceling switch or removal keeps the popover open and performs no mutation;
- closing the browser during Add Account leaves the rest of the popover interactive, and Cancel Adding Account stops the pending login;
- account rows display cached Usage while refresh runs;
- a short-interval timer test proves that a manual refresh postpones the previous deadline and cancellation stops later rounds;
- active profile remove button is disabled;
- disabling Show 5-hour Usage restores the existing weekly row layout;
- the menu-bar percentage remains weekly when 5-hour display is enabled.

## 6. Manual test matrix

With the packaged application:

1. open Settings and enable Launch at Login;
2. confirm `sfltool dumpbtm` contains `com.liuzhao.codex-account-switcher`;
3. if macOS reports approval required, use the displayed System Settings link, approve the item, and confirm the Toggle becomes enabled after reopening Settings;
4. quit the app, sign out and back in, and confirm the menu-bar item appears automatically;
5. disable Launch at Login and confirm the system registration is removed.

With two real test accounts:

1. add Account A;
2. add Account B;
3. open menu and confirm the existing weekly layout for both;
4. enable Show 5-hour Usage and confirm available 5h and 7d rows, then verify an account without 5-hour data omits only the 5h row;
5. confirm the menu-bar percentage still matches weekly Usage;
6. start a Codex CLI under A;
7. switch A → B;
8. with an active local chat, leave Desktop's native quit dialog pending and confirm a close-stage error after 30 seconds, with account A still active and Desktop still running; then finish or stop the task and close Desktop normally;
9. switch again and confirm Desktop reopens as B; reopen existing tasks and check their earlier and latest messages;
10. confirm the existing CLI was not terminated;
11. start a new CLI and confirm it uses B;
12. switch B → A;
13. disconnect network and confirm cached Usage remains visible with a warning;
14. remove the cache, disconnect network, and confirm Usage unavailable appears;
15. close the popover, wait five minutes, and confirm `usage-cache.json` receives a newer successful value;
16. force identity mismatch and confirm the original `auth.json` is restored while the mismatch remains visible;
17. make `accounts.json` unwritable and confirm the original `auth.json` is restored while the state-write failure remains visible;
18. make restoration fail and confirm both errors are shown.

## 7. Repository checks

Before release:

```text
only main branch remains
5-hour Usage defaults off and affects account rows only
4-hour and 6-hour windows are never labeled as 5-hour Usage
only the bounded verification/commit credential restoration exists
no general rollback state machine
no credential backup file
no transaction journal
no Keychain implementation
launch-at-login state comes from macOS Service Management
no account-rename UI or model operation
```

History safety regression tests cover a graceful exit taking more than two seconds, timeout and cancellation, no credential mutation after a close-stage failure, byte preservation of history/index/WAL files through A → B → A, and selection of Desktop's runtime override. These checks do not prove recovery of an already damaged Codex history projection.

## 8. Release automation checks

Personal fork: no release workflow. This section is kept only as history.

## 9. Whole-project ablation and integrity regression

New regression cases cover external-login contamination, successful RPC responses with a wrong target identity, account-list write failure before credential deletion, list restoration after deletion failure, a final JSON response without a newline, unrelated RPC error IDs, subprocess error details, numeric overflow, and Codex quota isolation from other metered products.
