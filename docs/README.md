## Product definition

Codex Account Switcher is a simple local menu-bar app for ordinary Mac users. The public workflow is: add accounts through browser sign-in once, choose from the menu bar, and let the app complete the confirmed Codex Desktop handoff. It requires no Terminal commands or config-file editing. Internally, the app manages a small set of authentication snapshots and activates the selected snapshot for Codex.

The intended user flow is:

```text
Open menu
→ inspect weekly Usage and optional 5-hour Usage
→ select account
→ confirm normal switch consequences
→ switch
```

The implementation flow is:

```text
Preflight
→ close Codex Desktop
→ save the current account's latest credentials
→ atomically activate the target credentials
→ verify the target identity through Codex
→ write activeAccountID
→ reopen Codex Desktop
```

The sequence is deliberately linear. Every step either succeeds or returns an error. Verification and registry-commit failures after activation restore the validated original profile credential; the implementation does not add a general recovery state machine around the switch.
